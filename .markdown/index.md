### Intro
This is my research project at the Victorian College of the Arts, University of Melbourne from 2014. At the moment, the notes and writing are scattered across different applications and throughout different media so I am trying to synthesize it all in Scrivener. I was interested in seeing how the process might work if it were more public so I wrote a script that, in a single command, converts a Scrivener project to a website and pushes it to a git repository (see: [scriv2web](https://seandockray.github.io/trials)).  - Sean Dockray

### Timeline
* **29 Aug 2016:** Iâ€™ve just written a script that will allow for publishing the work in process to the web. Now I have to import the work to Scrivener and convert it to plaintext/ Markdown formatting.
