> Does the institutional embrace of collaborative and interventionist art spell the end of the avant-gardist attack on art as a bourgeois individualist form? In his expanded review of Marc James Léger’s book Brave New Avant Garde, Bill Roberts begs to differ


### Notes

“consideration of the enduring problem of art’s autonomy as a social institution under capitalism”

Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of art’s central role in the reproduction of class inequality is a key touchstone for Léger’s book

Fraser’s work belongs to the category of what Léger – after Žižek, and after Jacques Lacan – calls today’s ‘sinthomeopathic’ practices: ‘the political version of identification with the symptom’

Žižek’s 1993 discussion of the Slovenian rock group Laibach - overidentification

in his penultimate essay, ‘The Subject Supposed to Over-Identify’, [Leger] argues at length to the effect that socially engaged practice is by and large caught in the position assigned by Lacan to the hysteric, insofar as its purported challenge to neoliberal capitalism – including what he takes to be its all too easy presumption of political agency – is really only a symptomatic expression of it; that the production of activist art is nothing less than a ‘capitalist demand’.

Léger insists that over-identification ‘is not a strategy of _critical complicity_, the major conceit of institutionalized actors, but a form of dissidence’.

It is difficult to draw any conclusion other than that practices of over-identification are merely an updated version of the ‘aesthetics of shock’ that Bürger long ago criticised in the case of Dada manifestations, not merely on the grounds of shock’s nonspecificity and transience, but for the fact that art is the very sphere where shock is, if not always anticipated, at least easily ‘consumed’ and recuperated; this, indeed, is the fundamental limitation of ‘institutionalized shock’.

Kester, countering BAVO’s position, argues that the group’s dismissal of ‘constructive critique’ rests on a ‘Manichean reform/revolution’ opposition that ignores the possibility of ‘insight through durational interaction rather than rupture’, that is, of the unpredictability of praxis itself. [durational interaction as entanglement, rupture as something like critique]

the distributions of authorship at work in collaborative and social practice of various kinds will, in one form or another, remain key to the endeavour of a critical art within actually existing capitalist society, marked as it is by the persistence of a bourgeois individualist ideology that has only deepened with the rise of these newer modes of subjectification. It is in this way that art’s autonomy may be sustained as an immanent critique of that autonomy, in the name of keeping alive the promise of its eventual overcoming.
