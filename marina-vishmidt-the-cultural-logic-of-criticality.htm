<blockquote>
<p>The text is concerned with charting the emergence of ‘criticality’ as a technology of legitimation and power in contemporary art institutions and proximate discourses. ‘Criticality’ is examined as a ‘cultural logic’ and compared to different philosophical iterations of critique for the correspondences and divergences. Cybernetics provides a model for analysing how critique becomes functional to the maintenance of existing states of affairs, then other potential political avenues for critique as rhetorical stance and praxis are evaluated through case studies.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>What Robert Smithson described as “cultural confinement” in 1972 has transformed from simple enclosure to something more adaptive, “porous and pervasive”. Now “opportunities arise for critique as a new type of added value”. <em>253</em></li>
<li>Looks at critique and participation as “two faces of a cultural logic that produce and mediate their own confinement” and draws together institutional/ immanent critique on one hand and self-regulation of systems (‘homeostasis’) on the other. <em>254</em></li>
<li>Critique as a form of negative feedback that only helps stabilize the system. “control simply cannot happen without participation” <em>254</em></li>
<li>An uneasy relationship between capital accumulation and symbolic capital accumulation now expresses itself in the behavior of cultural institutions (which see themselves as “democratic bulwarks against market imperatives” <em>255</em>) and the market (“a natural habitat for the institution of art as such, a smooth space which de facto includes everything” <em>255</em>)</li>
<li>“New institutionalism” as what Nina Möntmann called ‘institutionalization of critique’ absorbed decades of institutional critique into the structure of institution to transform museums. <em>255</em> But they failed to develop alliances with other disenfranchised and instead appealed to ‘cultural memory’ (not explained).</li>
<li>“the path of ‘criticism’ is always open, so long as the criticism does not take up ‘class power within art institutions themselves and across the commercial sectors with which they interact’ (Davies 2007)” <em>255</em></li>
<li>Institutions might re-distribute the resources they have to actually support communities they serve. How to open the conditions of ‘openness’ itself? <em>256</em></li>
<li>More Smithson: “disclose the confinement rather than make illusions of freedom” <em>256</em>/CC <em>155</em> and Vishmidt that under certain conditions, that “disclosure is the last illusion of freedom left standing” <em>256</em></li>
<li>Addresses Irit Rogoff’s ‘criticality’<span class="citation"><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> (<a href="irit-rogoff-smuggling-an-embodied-criticality.htm" class="uri">irit-rogoff-smuggling-an-embodied-criticality.htm</a>) which adopts the ambiguity and malaise of so much contemporary art (‘heightened awareness’) as opposed to criticism (demands position of authority) or critique (needs critical distance). <em>257</em></li>
<li>Rogoff oversimplifies critique by reducing it to insides/outsides, and proposes a more complex definition: “a relational dynamic with room for the proximity and contamination of subjects and objects of critique” <em>258</em></li>
<li>Points to 3 models of critique (Kant, Adorno, Marx) all of which (especially the latter two materialist ones) understand critique as “an analysis which is always implicated in its field, and a praxis which reflects the contingencies of its engagement” <em>258</em></li>
<li>Critique - prefigurative practices (Rowbotham et al. 1979) - “be the change you want to see”</li>
<li>ouch: “aristocratic ‘heightened sense of awareness’”</li>
<li>Rogoff dismisses critique because it judges rather than occupies, but Rogoff’s “occupation” requires the maintenance of institutions and the “solidarity of the powerful with each other” <em>258</em></li>
<li>The concept of ’smuggling’ as perfectly compatible with power (flexibility)</li>
<li>“If judgement is suspended by the advent of participatory criticality over distanced critique, things can indefinitely be left open, leaving an ambiguity productive for both the bastions of criticality and the targets of this criticality” <em>259</em></li>
<li>Comparing criticality with relational aesthetics - occupying crevices rather than risking expulsion</li>
<li>Participation: a criticality that “obviates a confrontation with structural antagonism and social injustice, or even the question of alternatives, in favour of a constructive exchange with the given state of affairs” <em>260</em> aligned with “careful avoidance of contradictions and the managerialism” of dominant cultural logic</li>
<li>Criticality : normative dissent :: participation : acceptability of control <em>260</em></li>
<li>History of feedback, systems, cybernetics as a way of making comparison to criticality</li>
<li>Cybernetics has been sublimated in a way into participation, which turns distribution of decision-making into technical concern <em>262</em></li>
<li>Appeal of participation “is its promise of overcoming divisions between governors and governed without invoking conflict or radical modification of the existing arrangements” <em>262</em></li>
<li>Participation, especially within social services or arts institutions, is self-management as means to getting audience to identify with the institution</li>
<li>Art examples: <em>The Interventionists</em> (MassMOCA, 2004), <em>Forms of Resistance</em> (Van Abbemuseum, 2007), <em>Populism</em> (CAC Vilnius; National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, Oslo; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam and Frankfurter Kunstverein, Frankfurt, 2005) and <em>The Art of Participation: 1950 to Now</em> (SF MOMA, 2008)</li>
<li>Participation, after institutional critique, moves site from “place” to “category of meaning” and institution from “container” to platform for practices. <em>263</em></li>
<li>“Participation, like criticality, can be a homoeostatic strategy that reflects at once a melancholy that change is no longer possible (or conceivable within art systems) hope that the change can be kept alive by the circulation of discourse about it, and eagerness to composite the fraying strands of legitimacy available to art institutions by providing a platform of sanctioned subversion.” <em>263</em></li>
<li>Description of art as a closed system (among many) within a larger closed system of capital. Any challenge to boundary is “formalist” due to the greater closure within capital. (Or, any subversion is still embedded within capitalist framework)</li>
<li>Poses immanent critique against criticality, “locate itself as a historically determinate aspect of that which it examines” (Postone 1993:143)</li>
<li>As long as freedom is deployed by institutions and by artists (for apparently different purposes, like aesthetic freedom and market freedom) both will be caught up in closure of capital</li>
<li>Abstract and legalistic concept of freedom that underpins institution of art (as opposed to the complex understandings of freedom within the individuals or programming) “leads to the tautology that ‘art is good’” <em>265</em></li>
<li>Could it be otherwise? Appeal to language of systems - not critique as feedback that stabilizes system to homeostatic position, but “maladaptation” <em>265</em> followed by several examples where critique caused reaction from powers</li>
<li>Reaction is only occasionally on ideological terms, but often displaced to protocol or health &amp; safety</li>
<li>Critique functions differently in different socio-political contexts, eg. Chto Delat? Consciousness raising would be innocuous in west but faces direct repression in Russia</li>
<li>“positive elaborations must somehow take seriously the condition of rupture and break as an opening for detaching and constituting on other grounds rather than ‘occupying’” <em>268</em></li>
